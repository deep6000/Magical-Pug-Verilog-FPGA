# Magical-Pug-Verilog-FPGA
The basic idea that I plan to implement is a game based on the Altera DE-1 SoC. The objective is to create a game called “Magical Pug”, where the movement of the pug will be controlled by the player. The pushbuttons on the development boards can be configured to enable movements of the pug in different directions. The pug has to be moved from the starting point to its destination by dodging the obstacles along the way. The duration for which the player is able to control the pug by dodging the obstacles, the harder it will get as the game progresses. The game will be displayed on the monitor (connected via a VGA connector). Bringing this game into hardware distinguishes our project from previous implementations as such games have been mainly implemented in software.
